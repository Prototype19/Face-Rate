  Face-Rate

<p align="center">
The Face Rate website gives the user a rating from 1 to 5 of any image of faces they upload using an homebrewed AI model. The purpose of this site was to apply the knowledge I gained about PyTorch in a more realworld setting. I created and deploy a classification AI model PyTorch model. I used Google Colab to create and train the model itself (You can find the ipynb file in this repo). Specfically I use the SCUT-FBP500 V2 Dataset from the Kaggle website. For the frontend I used the classic html, css, javascript combo (using AI to help fill any gaps in knowledge I had in frontend). I am current hosting the website
