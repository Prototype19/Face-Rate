## Overview
This project demonstrates end-to-end deployment of a deep learning model in a real-world web environment:  

- **Model Development**: Built and trained a convolutional neural network in **PyTorch** using the [SCUT-FBP500 V2 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pranavchandane/scut-fbp5500-v2-facial-beauty-scores). Training and experimentation were conducted in Google Colab (the notebook is included in this repository).  
- **Web Application**: Designed a lightweight frontend with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
- **Deployment**: Containerized the application with **Docker** and deployed it on **AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS)** for scalable hosting.
